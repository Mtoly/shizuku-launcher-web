Shizuku Launcher is a simple AWS Virtual Machine helper. Shizuku Launcher run completely on your machine, only sends your credentials to AWS, keeping your account safe.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Because of AWS SDK defect, this command includes a CI=false option.
